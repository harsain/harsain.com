A bit about myself, I am a Computer Software Engineer with more than 10 years of experience currently living in Melbourne, Australia.

For some time I have been contemplating whether it's worth or not but I decided to give it a shot and start a blog mainly to create a personal archive. I am not sure if I want to be regular but will try to be.

In the first blog I will document how I set up this website / blog.

Tech used:

- [Golang](https://go.dev/)
- [goenv](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/)
