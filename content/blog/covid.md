# My experience with COVID

So, after dodging COVID for so many years I starting to think / feel that I am reseliant to COVID or the vaccines are working wondoers for me.

## Back context
Before I share my experience with COVID a bit of a back story.
I had recently changed jobs and the new company for some reason expects all employees (Individual Contributors) to be in office for at least two days a week. I was on parental leave till May'2023. Now I took on the challenge of travelling in train and going into the crowded office where I was sure no one cared about precautions anymore. I had gone in for just second day and I could see throughout the office people coughing and sneezing. It being a flu season I assumed people are doing the right thing and testing for COVID as well.

## The start
It was Monday evening and I was prepping for Tuesday work from office. Assembling my new electric bike to travel from home to train station, made hot beverage and was going over my emails suddenly I starting coughing as if something was stuck in my throat. It was like small needles poking me in the throat.
